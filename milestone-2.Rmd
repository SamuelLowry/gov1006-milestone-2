```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
library(tidyverse)
library(foreign)
```

```{r summary}
#I uses read.dta from the foreign package in order to read in the summary data.
data <- read.dta(file = "raw_data/dataverse_files/caughey_warshaw_summary.dta") 

#I then ran a summary
summary(data)
```

I loaded in the summary data from the dataverse and then ran summary() on it per the milstone instructions.
